SINGAPORE – The next outdoor adventure for your kids could be closer to home than you think – and it can be enjoyed for free.

A number of estates now feature unique playgrounds, ditching the usual cookie-cutter designs.

These playgrounds, nestled among HDB flats, are more than just recreational areas. Some are designed with heritage elements to educate children while they have fun.

For instance, Tengah, once known for its fruit plantations in the 1950s, has a series of fruit-themed playgrounds. And Yew Tee has a playground structure resembling oil drums, a nod to its past as an oil storage depot during the Japanese Occupation.

Meanwhile, the newly renovated Waterplay space at Jacob Ballas Children’s Garden in the Singapore Botanic Gardens will be a hit with your kids.

Now spanning approximately 500 square meters—more than three times its original size—the expanded Waterplay features enhanced amenities and interactive elements designed to engage young visitors. The refreshed space offers a fun, immersive way for children to connect with nature while learning about essential environmental processes through play.

But if you are looking for somewhere near your home, there are many other free and fun places around the island. At Bidadari Park’s playground, for instance, your kids can make their way up a 5m-tall “tree house.”

And Pek Kio Park and Tampines Boulevard Park feature nature-inspired play gardens with balancing logs and stepping stumps constructed from the wood of felled trees. These play elements promote environmental awareness while encouraging your children to connect with nature.

So, fill up the water bottles, slather on that sunscreen, and head to these HDB estate and park playgrounds for a day of fun with your kids.

### **Adventure Playwoods, Bidadari Park**

A 5m-tall “tree house,” built next to a Tembusu tree, forms the centerpiece of this nature-inspired play garden at Bidadari Park, which opened in September 2024.

The towering play structure features long slides, climbing nets, and a net tunnel that will challenge your children’s sense of balance and coordination. Reaching the lookout point will give them a sense of accomplishment and allow them to take in a bird’s-eye view of the surroundings.

They can also experience the thrill of soaring through the air on a zip line and the joy of building castles in the sandpits.

There are restrooms, a water cooler, and a vending machine stocked with drinks close by.

After playtime, stroll through the vast park with your children and share the enchanting inspiration behind the green space: **Hundred Acre Wood** from the classic storybook *Winnie-the-Pooh* (1926) by A.A. Milne.

### **Fruit-themed playgrounds, Tengah Garden Avenue**

The newly developed Plantation Grange estate in Tengah pays tribute to the area’s history as a fruit plantation in the 1950s with a series of fruit-themed playgrounds.

One of the highlights is **Ong Lye Garden** at Block 132A. You will find a large yellow pineapple structure, in which children can climb up using ropes, explore the inside, and then zoom down the green slide.

Nearby at **Block 132C’s Durian Paradise**, two play structures inspired by the king of fruit provide even more climbing challenges, swings, and spiral slides for children aged six and above.

Younger children have not been forgotten. A **“fruit farm”** in front of Block 131A features play structures inspired by a pineapple, a watermelon, and two bananas, encouraging imaginative play.

Toddlers and pre-schoolers can pretend to harvest the fruit and hop on a red “lorry” for added excitement. There is plenty of running space for your little ones here.

Hungry after all the fun? Head over to **Plantation Plaza**—just a street away—for a variety of dining options.

### **Oil Drum Playground, Block 619C Choa Chu Kang North Avenue 7**

The play space, opened in August 2024, is a short walk from **Yew Tee MRT station** and sheltered by the elevated train tracks. Its design draws inspiration from Yew Tee’s history as an oil storage depot during the Japanese Occupation.

The area is designed for young children to crawl, explore, and imagine. It features three small and two large orange “oil drums” with a gentle slide and low-level nets.

Also vying for your kids’ attention is a **small water park with shooting jets and fountains**. So, remember to pack a change of clothes for them. There is a changing room available.

### **Octopus Play, Block 801C West Coast Crescent**

Nestled among the HDB blocks near **West Coast Beach**, the playground’s key structure draws inspiration from a colossal sea creature.

The **purple octopus** has “tentacles” that offer varied climbing routes for kids to explore its interior. They can continue their ascent to a rope and wire mesh bridge, which leads to a slide.

In addition to the main play structure, the area offers a number of alternatives for younger children. There is a **merry-go-round, two shorter slides, and two low hammock swings**.

If your kids still have energy to burn, head across the street to the beach for some fun in the sand.

### **Flying Birds and Bird’s Tower, Sengkang East Drive**

Located near **Block 172A in Sengkang East Drive**, **Flying Birds** is an aviary-themed playground featuring three towering “bird nests” in shades of blue and yellow.

Your kids will have a blast crawling through robust rope tunnels that link up the nests and zipping down the long slides.

They can hone their agility and coordination skills as they maneuver through the obstacle course’s **swinging rubber hammock mats**.

A short walk away, near **Block 175A and the Sungei Serangoon Park Connector**, is **Bird’s Tower**, an expansive play area that exudes beach vibes.

Your kids will gain a sense of accomplishment when they get to the “viewing decks” after conquering the netted course.

They will also enjoy the spacious **sandpits**, a rare find in modern HDB playgrounds, where they can build sandcastles and other creations.
